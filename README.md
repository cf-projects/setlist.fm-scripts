# setlist.fm-scripts
Various scripts to help collect and organize data from the setlist.fm API. Please refer to the setlist.fm website for questions about the API directly: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html.

**What the project does**
This project includes various scripts to play with a real world API (specifically setlist.fm) and pull information in an organized manner. 

**Why the project is useful**
As of 21.10.13, the setlist.fm API only allows you to pull one page (up to 20 setlists) of information per request. For some bands and artist this may be enough, however more established artists have been on tour for much longer (decades) than 20 setlists thus necesitating an automated API request script. The JSON data provided by the API can be difficult to read as well. There are scripts here to better organize and view the information.
  
**How users can get started with the project**
These scripts are built for Python 3.9.6 (tags/v3.9.6:db3ff76, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32. Each script has its required modules/libraries at the top. 
  
**Where users can get help with your project**
The scripts have clear comments for each step. Please open a new issue on the project if you have questions, errors, or suggestions. You can also contact me directly through email. 

**Who maintains and contributes to the project**
